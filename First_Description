Game of Life - Basic Concepts
	
	First of all we need to implement two principal classes for the cells, sexed cells, and asexual cells.
	 First class will produce a random number of sexed cells, in limit of an integer, because we need to have the oportunity to see the progress of the division and multiplication of the cells. First class will have two properties, sexed_starve, and sexed_full, which are used to see the starving status of the sexed cells. We will try to implement this type of characteristics with functions and parameters, to verify every single sexed cell. We need a count which need to count the meals of the sexed cells. After count >= 10 and two sexed cells will meet , count will reset and the number of the sexed cells, will be incremented with 1. We will have a function, road_to_die which will be built for starving cells, and at the end of the execution will decrement the number of the cell with the n units, because we will try to verify all the sexed cells.
	Second class will be in the same manner like the first one, we will create a random number of asexual cells, we will implement asexual_starve and asexual_full, which have the role to see the hunger status of the asexual starving(we will implement in both class time functions). We will try to implement this type of characteristics with functions and parameters, to verify every single asexual cell. We will implement a count parameter or function to see and register the number of the meals, for each cell, when one cell will have the count == 10, the count will reset, and after that , number of cell will be incremented by 1. Road_to_die function is the same like in the other class, and have the same role.
	Concurence principle :
  1. If two sexed cells or asexual cells meet, they will fight, and the winner will be cell which is less starver, in case of equality, they will share the food
  2. If two asexual cells cells meet, the less starving will receive a greather portion of food, and the other one will receive the rest, in case of equality, they will share the food 
  3. If an asexual cells and a sexual cell meet, the asexual cell has the priority, because for asexual cells is more easier to multiply
	Food portion - food portion will be diplayed on map, in random number for 2 to 10(to use for concurency, 1 can not be shared); 
	After sexual multiplication, sexed or asexual, we will take in consideration the new starving cells. We will make two functions or methods(new_sexed and new_asexed) which will pass at the prime category of each type of cell
	Condition of cell will be implemented with timestamp  and units of food, we need to see the progress and the time requirements for developing and destroying a population.
